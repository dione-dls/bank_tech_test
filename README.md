## Running the Tests

## Approach to Solving the Problem

  To understand the requirements of the project, I began by creating user stories from a bank client's perspective.

#### User Stories

```sh
AS A client
I WANT to open a bank account
SO THAT I have a place to keep my money
```
```sh
AS A client
I WANT to deposit money to my bank account
SO THAT I can increase the money I save
```
```sh
AS A client
I WANT to withdraw money from my bank account
SO THAT I can use some of the money that I have saved
```
```sh
AS A client
I WANT to see my bank account statement
SO THAT I can keep track of my bank account transactions
```
  Next I have created a diagram to better understand what classes I need to create in order to make a command line application with the following specifications.
